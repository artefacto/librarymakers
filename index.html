<h2>Welcome to LibraryMakers (alpha)</h2>


<p>We created this site as a place to find and share content for makers in the library. 
</p>
<p>This website aims to help fill the gap in the professional development and support for library staff in introducing and supporting maker activities in the library. </p>
We're currently in alpha while we work out what kind of shape it takes, test recipes and add our backlog of content. If you have any questions, suggestions or features youâ€™d particularly like to see, just let us know.</p>
</div>

<p>Here's some content to help you get started</p>
