<h2>Welcome to LibraryMakers (alpha)</h2>


<p>We created this site as a place to find and share content for makers in the library. This includes workshops and activities for patrons (children, adults and everything in between) as well as useful guides for library staff.
</p>
<p>This website aims to help fill the gap in the professional development and support for library staff in introducing and supporting maker activities in the library. </p>
We're currently in alpha while we work out what kind of shape it takes, test recipes and add our backlog of content. If you have any questions, suggestions or features youâ€™d particularly like to see, just let us know.</p>
</div>

<p>Here's some content to help you get started</p>


<ul>
<li>An introduction to 'making'</li>
<li>A beginner's guide to Arduino</li>

</ul>
