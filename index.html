<h2>Welcome to LibraryMakers (alpha)</h2>


<p>We created this site as a place to find and share content for makers in the library. This includes workshops and activities for patrons (children, adults and everything in between) as well as useful applications for library staff.
</p>
<p>
This site is currently in alpha while we work out what kind of shape it takes, test recipes and add our backlog of content. If you have any questions, suggestions or features youâ€™d particularly like to see, just let us know.</p>
</div>

<p>Here's some content to help you get started</p>


<ul>
<li>An introduction to 'making'</li>
<li>A beginner's guide to Arduino</li>

</ul>


<h3>Categories</h3>
{% for category in site.categories %}

        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/category/{{ category | first}}/">
            {{ category | first }}
        </a>
        {% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}

{% endfor %}
<h3>Tags</h3>
<div class="tagcloud">
{% for tag in site.tags %}

    <li style="font-size: {{ tag | last | size | times: 100 | divided_by: site.tags.size| plus: 70 }}%">
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tags/{{ tag | first |downcase | slugize }}/">
            {{ tag | first }} ({{ tag | last | size }})
