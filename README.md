## Overview


We created this site as a place to find and share content for makers in the library. This includes guides, support materials, workshops and activities for library users and staff  

This project aims to help fill the gap in the professional development and support for library staff in introducing and supporting maker activities in the library.

## How to contribute

There are lots of different ways you can contribute including by creating a pull request with new or updated content or adding new issues for features, suggestions or ways you'd like to get involved.


### Who are we
