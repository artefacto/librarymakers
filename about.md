<p style="clear:both">This is a project to bring together various different aspects of our work with makers and makerspaces in libraries and because it's something that we looked for and couldn't find. </p>

It's collaborative and open (hopefully even more so in the future).

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* [The Poole theme](https://github.com/poole/)
* Various icons from the Noun Project
