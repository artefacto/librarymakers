<em>One only needs two tools in life: WD-40 to make things go, and duct tape to make them stop.‚Äù</em>

<p style="clear:both">This was a project to bring together various different aspects of our work with makers and makerspaces in libraries and because it's something that we looked for and couldn't find. It's collaborative and open (hopefully even more so in the future).</p>

* Various icons from the Noun Project
