## What is it?

The BBC Micro:bit is a tiny, codeable computer developed by BBC and a plethora of other partner organisations (29 partners!) and made available for free to every child in year 7 (or equivalent) across the UK.

In 2016 the Micro:bit Foundation was formed and ownership transferred from the BBC.

The device supports motion detection and bluetooth technology out of the box and includes a built in compass.

You can connect it directly to your computer to write, compile and upload code via a USB cable.

It can also be powered by 2 x AAA 1.5 V batteries (with additional battery pack add-on) for when running code when not attached to your computer.


## What it does
It originally came with 4 different coding environments to help teach people to code.

- Javascript - Code King drag and drop programming environment
- Blog Editor - Drag and Drop editor developed by Microsoft
- Touch develop - A text-based programming language developed for mobile devices
- MicroPython -  A text-based editor with autocomplete snippets based on a customised version of the Python 3 programming language.

In 2017, [this was simplified to 2 main editors](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000050402-code-editors-what-s-changing-and-when-) (though the legacy editors are still available).

- JavaScript Blocks Editor (PXT)
- Python Editor

Each editor comes with a tutorial to follow to help you get started.

You can also import a script from a file on your computer. These can be .hex files created in the Micro:bit or .jsz files (a compressed json format)
