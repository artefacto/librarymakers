## What is it ?
MaKey Makey is a great introduction tool into the world of electronics and basic coding.
It's very simple to use, thus suitable for absolute beginners of all ages with no prior technical knowledge required.

It works on the same principle like a basic circuitry. Using this simple invention kit allows you to turn every-day (conductive) objects into a keyboard, hence Makey Makey, and connect them with the internet. For example, you can create a magical vegetable piano simply by connecting MaKey MaKey with your favourite vegetables and your computer.

A great thing about MaKey MaKey is its compatibility with Arduino. Using Arduino you can easily reprogramme the MaKey Makey and customise the key-mapping to suit your project's needs.

For more advanced users we highly recommend to install the Arduino Addon, which makes the MaKey MaKey even more fun to play with.
