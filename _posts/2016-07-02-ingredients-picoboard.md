## What is it?

The PicoBoard (also known as ScratchBoard) is an open source board which, similar to MaKey MaKey, allows us to easily connect a Scratch program to the physical world.

What you find on the board

1. Light sensor
2. Sound sensor
3. Pushbutton
4. Slider
5. 4 x Resistance connectors
6. USB connector

## What it does

The PicoBoard can sense levels of sound and light, the electrical resistance in a circuit using alligator clips, the position of the slider and the state of its pushbutton.

What you can do with the PicoBoard

The PicoBoard has been used to make controllers, interactive games, alarm systems and many more exciting projects.

For example, using the button and slider you can control a character in your favourite video game. Or, using the light or sound sensor you can change how a sprite character behaves or looks according to the levels of sound and light in your environment.
