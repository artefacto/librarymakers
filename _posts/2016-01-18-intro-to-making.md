## What do we mean 'making'?
When we talk about ‘making’ and ‘maker’ culture we are referring to cultural production whereby users become producers rather than just consumers.

And at the heart of 'maker' culture is digital literacy and connected learning.

To use an example from the Remake Learning Playbook, the NYPL and MOUSE created a maker programme for young people that first gets them building things and then ‘builds more real-world skills like resilience and advanced creativity and technical skills from there’. This in turn influenced the New york Department of Education’s Office of Post-Secondary Readiness = their Digital Ready programme.
