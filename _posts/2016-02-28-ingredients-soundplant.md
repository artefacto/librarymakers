## What is it

Soundplant is the computer keyboard sound triggering software developed by Marcel Blum.

It is a digital audio program which turns your computer keyboard into a sound-triggering device or juke box.

By drag and drop, you can easily assign sound files of any format and size into all keyboard keys with no extra hardware needed.

You can use Soundplant in performance, as an educational aid, as a presentation, as an instrument, as a DJ set and many more.

By using Soundplant you can mix together tracks in realtime, create loops, sketch sound designs, or trigger sound effects.

It runs easily on any Windows or Mac computers, but for optimal performance a multicore processor and 4GB of RAM are recommended.
