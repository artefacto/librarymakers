## What is it ?
Sonic Pi is a programming environment developed by Dr Sam Aaron (from the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory) to teach programming concepts via a live coding instrument. Often described as  *‘The Live Coding Synth for Everyone’*, it’s based on the Ruby programming language and can be used both as a teaching resource and as a musical instrument.
