## What you need

- MaKey MaKey (including Mini-B USB cable)
- Male to male jumper wires
- Alligator clip
- Soundplant software
- Computer (any Windows or Mac of the past 8 years will do, but for optimal performance a multicore processor and 4GB RAM is recommended)
- Various conductive objects
- 6 Sound files - Sound/music files of any format and size
- Speakers (optional)



## How
1. Connect MaKey MaKey into your computer using USB cable. Plug the small side of USB cable into MaKey Makey and the big side into your computer. (If your computer asks you to install the drivers, simply click cancel or close the window.)
2. Open this link on your browser [http://soundplant.org/](http://soundplant.org/) to access and download the *Soundplant* software.
3. Open *Soundplant*. Make sure it is open on your screen all the time.
4. Drag and drop your sound files onto the keyboard keys you would like to use on Soundplant. In this case we assign individual sounds onto keys **W; A; S; D; F; G**.
5. Connect to Earth - Now you can connect one end of an alligator clip to the bottom of MaKey MaKey which is marked as “Earth”.
6. Connect to Yourself - Then you hold the other end of the alligator clip (the metal part) between your fingers, and now you become “grounded”.
7. Connect MaKey MaKey to various conductive objects - If you want your objects to become your keyboard keys, you connect them to your MaKey MaKey with the help of jumper wires. On the back left side of MaKey MaKey you find six letters W; A; S; D; F; G. Connect each of them with male to male jumper wires to your selected conductive objects.

Now you can play your favourite sounds by touching your selected conductive objects with your "grounded' hand.
