The tutorial will walk you through the steps you need to take to create the example script - though it's not always clear where the required code block is located.

Each completed step will be crossed off as you move onto the next one.

The required script block or ‘chunk’ will be highlighted in orange to help you identify it

It can take some time to get used to how the code blocks are organised. You have the Actions and Controls, Library,  Language and Snippets menus as well as the list of tutorials available

You can restart or continue the tutorial at any stage by returning to edit your script and clicking on the tutorial name again.
