## What is it ?
littleBits are an open source electronic module platform of electronic building blocks that are designed for prototyping and experimenting with electronics. They’re a useful and fun tool for learning about Internet of Things and basic circuitry, though they are a little more expensive to get started with than other electronics kits.

The company was started by Ayah Bdeir and, [for the most part](https://support.littlebits.cc/hc/en-us/articles/201479547-What-parts-of-littleBits-products-aren-t-Open-Source), the Little Bits circuit designs are open source.

The modules are colour-coded and there are currently over 60 modules in the library that can be connected to form different combinations.

1. The Power Bit, Battery & Cable
You need a  power Bit, a 9V battery, and a littleBits battery cable to start a circuit.

Bits are grouped into four color-coded categories:

2. <span class ="blue">POWER</span> is blue - every circuit needs a power bit to start with

3. <span class ="pink">INPUT</span> is pink. These provide information and signals to the Bits

4. <span class ="green">OUTPUT</span> is green. These  are the ‘doing’ bits. They complete an action or a task (such as a light or movement). These

5. <span class ="orange">WIRE Bits</span> let you expand the circuit’s reach and change direction and can also be used to add programmability to your circuit.

Order of operation matters - Always start with a Power bit and remember that input Bits only affect the Bits that come after them.

## Recipes

There are a series of lessons for littleBits on the official website, including beginner and intermediate tutorials. You can also upload your own.

Check out the ['Hack my House' workshop for beginners](http://littlebits.cc/lessons/hack-my-house-workshop) which includes the 3-d paper structure templates to download and use.
