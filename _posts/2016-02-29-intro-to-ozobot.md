## What is it ?
Ozobot is a tiny robot toy which could be easily packed in a ping-pong ball. Five optical sensors placed underneath of the robot enable Ozobot to sense its environment and navigate within it. Ozobot can follow the line drawn on a piece of paper or your smart tablet. It can also detect colours and read specific factory preprogrammed colour sequences. In addition Ozobot can be easily programmed with the OzoBlockly programming language which is similar to Scratch.
