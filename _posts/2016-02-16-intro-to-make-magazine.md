## Intro

MAKE Magazine celebrates the philosophy of the Maker movement. It is a bimonthly magazine published by Maker Media which features Do-It-Yourself and Do-It-Together projects involving computing, robotics, electronics, 3D printing, woodworking and many other disciplines such as knitting, weaving, printing, bookbinding etc.

Each volume offers articles and columns related to a particular theme, but the main focus is on step-by-step projects ranging from easy to difficult. The Skill Builder sections explores the tools and techniques needed to realise to most challenging projects. It also features a Toolbox section including reviews of books and tools.
