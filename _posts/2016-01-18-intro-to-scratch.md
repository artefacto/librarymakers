## What is it ?
Scratch is a programming language that allows you to create your interactive stories, games and animations by using blocks as scripts. By dragging, dropping and connecting blocks into the Script area you can easily create a program of your choice. Each object in Scratch is called a sprite. You can add a new sprite and customise it according to your needs. To make it more exciting you can add a sound, change colours, add a backdrop and effects, and other fun stuff.
Scratch is designed especially for ages 8 to 16, but widely used by people of all ages.
Using Scratch is an easy and fun start into the world of programming.
