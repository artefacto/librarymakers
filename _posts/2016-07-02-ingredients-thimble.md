## What is it ?
Thimble is an online coding tool to help you learn or teach coding in HTML and CSS.

Itâ€™s part of the Mozilla WebMaker suite designed to help people gain skills in web literacy. As well as creating and publishing your own web page, you are also able to remix existing thimble projects https://thimble.mozilla.org/

<!--more-->

Thimble makes it easy to teach web coding skills because you can write and edit code in the code editor and immediately see a preview of your web page on the screen at the same time.

You can click on the Remix this Project button for one of the popular projects on the home page (or another Thimble page you have discovered) to create your own copy of this.

These projects also come with Teaching Kits. You can also discover other teaching resources via https://learning.mozilla.org/ or create and share your own.
