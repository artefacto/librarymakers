IFTTT (If This Then That) is a service that lets you connect to web apps and services to automate processes using simple conditional statements in the format If This Than That. The ‘If This’ part of the recipe is the trigger while (…Then That.) is the response. These statements are collated as ‘recipes’ that you can share and reuse.
