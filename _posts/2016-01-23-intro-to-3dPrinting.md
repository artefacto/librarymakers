## What is it ?
3D Printing is the process of creating three-dimensional physical objects from a digital file. It’s also sometimes called additive manufacturing as the process is based on adding layer after layer of material until the object is complete.

There are now different processes used by 3D printers for converting a 3D Model into a physical object but the most common methods used are Stereolithography (SLA) and Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)/Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) (the names are used interchangeably - it’s just that FDM was trademarked by Stratasys Inc so FFF was developed as alternative terminology). Most consumer 3d Printers use this method.

The process involves feeding a thermoplastic substance into the 3d Printer where it is melted and turned into a 3D object based on the design instructions fed into the printer.
