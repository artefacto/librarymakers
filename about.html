            <h4>About this site</h4>
            <p>This is a project to bring together different tools and resources for makers and makerspaces in libraries that can be edited, re-used and remixed as required.

  <p>It’s collaborative and open and we’re always looking for new contributions. These recipes are designed to help you get started, they’re by no means meant to be followed to the letter.
